 * some notes:
 * - https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/AudioManager#getStreamVolumeDb(int,%20int,%20int)
 *   - problems: sdk 28 required; I read on SO that samsung broke it and it returns values 0~1
 *   - on O you can use it via AudioSystem C++; on O MR1 you can use it via AudioSystem java reflection
 * - AudioSystem::getStreamVolume() in C++
 *   - it was removed recently but exists everywhere I need it https://cs.android.com/android/_/android/platform/frameworks/av/+/38c45a4438915c73434558be9ffc2d4f73516cf2
 *   - interpretation of data changed in M https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/av/+/ffbc80f5908eaf67a033c6e93a343c39dd6894eb%5E!/
 *
 * if boost is <=3dB, could also use https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/main/+/main:system/media/audio/include/system/audio.h;l=561;drc=8063e42c30fdde36835c1862cf413d8faeadcf45
 * but that has risk of clipping when system volume is high so that's a bad idea.
 *
 * also need to disable LoudnessController and MPEG-4/MPEG-D DRC and normalization
 * https://github.com/androidx/media/tree/media_codec_param
 * prototype upstream to edit these kind of things ^^^
 *
 * Boost has two primary purposes: make ReplayGain sound louder to make it more enjoyable, and free
 * up headroom for advanced EQ (DSP plugins or AudioEffect DPE/Equalizer/BassBoost/etc both). For
 * practical reasons boost is all or nothing - the boost value does not change between songs for any
 * reason!! Songs that shouldn't be boosted instead get negative boost gain before volume control
 * stage. For one, doing that prevents bugs blasting away user ears. And doing it differently is
 * useless for RG because we can't increase volume if gain is positive but clipping-safe through low
 * peaks, and also useless for EQ because we can either apply negative boost gain through
 * DPE/Equalizer or we don't have any EQ available anyway... (with BassBoost being the only possible
 * exception, but if there is BassBoost but not DPE/Equalizer then either they're busy because
 * external EQ app in which case our BassBoost should be disabled, or the SoC vendor is really weird
 * and decided we only need BassBoost but no Equalizer or DPE, but afaik none of them did).
 * The entire Boost feature will not be possible to enable in combination with offload, unless of
 * course Boost during offload (means both Volume and DPE or LoudnessEnhancer) is supported on this
 * device, i.e. you can't set Boost to apply just during non-offload while offload is enabled.
 *
 * A negative-gain-only ReplayGain in offload is allowed, if so desired. The user will be shown a
 * warning dialog when enabling the later of two settings.
 *
 * Also, it turns out Boost can be influenced with Equalizer/BassBoost/Virtualizer, because if at
 * max volume or if volume control isn't granted to LVM, the added energy by these effects will be
 * compensated through gain correction that will instead just make the signal less loud
 * (no DRC, yay! at least in AOSP impl). So using Boost while someone else is setting Equalizer to
 * high values can also lead to reduced gain. That however isn't a problem and hence can be safely
 * ignored, everything's WAI.
 *
 * for ReplayGain non-offload:
 * - if non-RG track, boost gain but inverted, hence negative, should be applied via GainProcessor
 * - negative RG gain could be applied either via GainProcessor
 *     setVolume() would mean I'd need to consider it in boost calculations, so let's skip that
 * - positive RG gain would be applied via GainProcessor
 *     if gain is positive and peaks are so high that it'd clip, reduce gain or use DRC like DPE can
 * - boost would be added via Volume effect
 *
 * offload ReplayGain (DPE effect is offloadable):
 * - if non-RG track, set DPE effect to apply inverted boost gain
 * - negative RG gain should be applied either via setVolume()
 * - positive RG gain could be applied via DPE.Limiter.postGain/LoudnessEnhancer effect
 *     if gain is positive and peaks are so high that it'd clip, reduce gain or use the effect's DRC
 *     DPE has DRC via MBC stage, but we shall use single band (Limiter alone is not suitable)
 * - boost would be added via Volume effect (if volume isn't offloadable, boost can't be enabled)
 * TODO: another problem with using DPE is that it can be busy. EQ apps could work in offload as
 *  long as there's no conflict between apps. So what to do if DPE and LoudnessEnhancer+Volume are
 *  both not free? Just fall back to no boost and setVolume()? Or hide our session ID from EQ apps?
 *  Or can we use priority constructor arg to win against EQ apps?
 *
 * offload ReplayGain (LoudnessEnhancer+Volume is offloadable):
 * LoudnessEnhancer target gain may at most be -8dBFS unless DRC is desired. If we FORCE operation
 * similar to boost mode using additional headroom gain (16dB should be very safe), we can still do
 * RG adjustment.
 * - if non-RG track, set LoudnessEnhancer effect to apply inverted boost gain
 * - negative RG gain should be applied via LoudnessEnhancer, set lower than -8dBFS
 * - positive RG gain should still be applied via LoudnessEnhancer, set close to but at most -8dBFS
 * - DRC is not supported, LoudnessEnhancer does DRC when gain >= -8dBFS but it's heavily tuned to
 *   speech, must avoid at all costs
 * - boost and additional headroom gain would be added via Volume effect
 * The big advantage of this weird scheme is wide compatibility with equalizer apps. But whether
 * it's worth implementing would be decided by how often LoudnessEnhancer+Volume combo is
 * offloadable.
 *
 * offload ReplayGain (volume but no DPE or LoudnessEnhancer effect available):
 * Problem: can't increase volume if there is unused headroom (low peak) but positive RG gain.
 *          that defeats much of the purpose of RG.
 * Equalizer can't be used because a 5 or 10-band biquad filter is not suitable to increase gain
 * linearly, and distortions defeat much of the purpose of ReplayGain (-> enjoyable music listening)
 * Hence we can't use Volume effect alone if offloaded, proceed below.
 *
 * offload ReplayGain (no effects): just use setVolume() for negative gain, and give up on
 * positive gain (has to be acknowledged by user when enabling RG+offload combination on those
 * devices).
 *
 * For "smart album/track gain selection": the used gain is always determined at audio track init.
 * Album gain will be used if track from same album is either prev or next in playlist. If user adds
 * same album track after we started playing we shall hold onto chosen gain until seek or next
 * track happens. Also that implies that if there are two songs that could be played gaplessly, they
 * should NOT be played gaplessly unless RG gain is also same. (TODO: for offload only, or always?)
 * That effectively avoids audible volume jumps, and allows to change effect settings for offloaded
 * RG in synchronized way as well, avoiding wrong gain applied to audio frame.
 *
 * ID3 variations to support: RVA2 (ID3v2.4), XRVA (ID3v2.3), RGAD (ID3v2.3), TXXX with ReplayGain
 * info. see https://wiki.hydrogenaudio.org/index.php?title=ReplayGain_2.0_specification#ID3v2
